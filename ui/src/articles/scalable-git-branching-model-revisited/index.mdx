excerpt: Explanation of and updates to the Scaled Git Branching Model
---

Recently, I had a discussion with Abraham French, one of the original co-authors
of the Scalable Git Branching Model, and we realized that it is time for some
updates.

In the seven years since I wrote up the original definitive article on the
[Scalable Git Branching Model][scaled-git-flow], I've led dozens of teams in
thinking through branching using it, developing custom processes for each. To
name a few:

* Small projects that developers use in mentorship can leverage the Scalable Git
  Branching model in a way that mostly looks like a CI/CD workflow, with `main`
  being the latest working code.
* Small professional projects through a prototype-to-release phase where the
  project did not have a production environment initially.
* Medium-sized projects with a small number of teams of developers using a
  "release train"-like process with "release candidates", including pre-planned
  cascading releases.
* One large project with many teams, each with their own release candidates, all
  keeping them isolated.

The common thread in all of them is that the Scalable Git Branching Model
assists developers in thinking about dependency management at the branch level.
Unfortunately, the original analogy used to explain how dependencies work was
incorporated into the terminology of the model, which warrants updates.

## The Analogy

Imagine your codebase like a river. We mark a few pools and lakes along the way
as "branches", but code ultimately flows downstream over time. Each time a
developer makes a change, it's like dye being added to the water - it's really
hard to remove once it's been combined with other code. Tributaries from other
teams flow in and can affect significantly the quality and shape of our river,
so we want to keep our water as pure as we can until we know it's safe to use.
Eventually, the "safe" code should flow into a spot where QA can check it (like
a release candidate branch) before it is released.

This analogy really is a way to think about dependency management, and while the
analogy is useful, for those classically trained in dependency management
(especially project managers), the branching model was unnecessarily difficult
to understand and help direct.

## The Business Case

In addition to standard Git features like working collaboratively, this
branching model supports:

* Common scenarios:
    * Gated releases with QA/management final approval.
    * Tracking features in a release.
    * Tagged releases for auditing.
* Unique scenarios that other branching models don't usually support include:
    * Planning for future releases.
    * Supporting multiple past releases.
    * Dropping features from a release.
    * Framework/infrastructure branches that do not correspond to a single
      feature.

## An Aside: Model vs. Strategy

This article refers to a "branching model", but most developers want to know
what the "branching strategy" is for a team. What's the difference between a
model and a strategy?

* A model is a way to think about a particular problem set. By having a common
  model for a problem set, people can be assured they're using the same terms
  the same way and can construct solutions that may not have been outlined by a
  strategy.
* A strategy, in this sense, is more of a collection of playbooks, intended to
  help team members follow a set of proceedures without needing to reason about
  every decision.

Having both a model and a strategy is important in both debugging issues that
arise and in keeping cognitive load low on the team.

## The Changes

Previous versions of the branching model talked about upstream/downstream, but
this version will use dependencies/dependants. We'll also highlight a couple of
strategies using this model at the end of the article.

## The branching model: The Principles

The following principles are the main tenants of the branching model:

* **Isolation until Finalized**: Keep changes isolated from unrelated changes
  until both timeline and quality have been confirmed or that the change is not
  unrelated and is actually a dependency.
* **Multiple Dependencies**: Any change may have multiple dependency tasks.
* **Immediate Propagation to Dependents**: Any new change to a task should be
  immediately reflected in dependant tasks.
    * Further note: this should also not skip dependency levels; if there is a
      dependency chain such that C depends on B and B depends on A, do not merge
      A directly into C, but ensure that A is merged into B first, then B into C.

The following principles come as a course of understanding the above principles
thoroughly, but are worth stating directly; for the math-major readers, these
are theorems.

* **No backwards propagation.** Once a change is code-complete, do not
  automatically merge it into its dependencies; this breaks the "Isolation until
  Finalized" principle. Instead, keep it separated until your team's strategy
  dictates that it is sufficiently tested to be merged into a dependency.
* **No branch is sacred.** Once a branch has outlived its usefulness (either
  because it is merged or if it is corrupted with untested code), it should be
  removed. In your strategy, every branch should have a clear start and end.
* **Move infrastructure out.** Infrastructure changes, such as updates to CI/CD
  processes, package dependencies, etc. should be tracked as their own changes
  to have dependants of their own.
* **Limit dependencies.** Also part of "Isolation until Finalized", don't take
  on a dependency for a change that isn't needed.

## Considerations for your Branching Strategy

Writing a branching strategy is a critical part of ensuring a healthy software
development life-cycle. You may want to make some changes, but here are some
pointers to keep in mind.

1. **How many versions do you need to maintain?** Most projects only need to
   maintain the latest release, but sometimes you need to maintain multiple back
   releases, or multiple related product lines, such as a "community" version
   and a "professional" version. If you can say "professional has everything
   community has plus..." then your community version is a dependency of your
   professional version, and you could use multiple Service Lines (below) to
   track that.
2. **How frequently do you release?** If you release every feature as soon as it
   is ready, you don't need a separate branch type to represent "release
   candidates". However, if you release once every other week with a batch of
   changes, take a look at the Release Candidate (below) branch types to track
   them.
3. **Are there fixed environments, other than your production environment(s)?**
   If you have stable "QA", "Staging", "Dev", "Training", or "Demo"
   environments, rather than using a branch to track them, consider using a tag
   that points to a commit when deployed. By not having a branch for each
   environment, you can avoid that branch from deviating from any service line;
   it only becomes out of date.

Keep in mind that these are actually business-related questions, not technology
questions. If you are a technical decision-maker writing the branching strategy,
make sure you take into account the needs of the business as you write the
process.

Also, keep in mind that, because this branching model lends itself to designing
strategies, you do not need to design every edge case at the beginning of the
project: keep it super simple at first, and add extra workflows as needed.

## Common Branch Types

The following are a few branch type definitions; include the ones you need in
your own branching strategy, and consider the rest for future expansions. See
the Common Workflows section below for typical development workflows.

### Service Lines

A "service line" represents a line of your product, application, or library that
is actively maintained. This could represent a version of the codebase (such as
the "community" and "professional" example above), a handful of the most recent
releases to support ("v1.0", "v1.1", and "v2.0"), or you may have only one
"main" service line. Either way, a service line has the following characteristics:

* **Creation**: A service line branch should be created when it is apparent that
  a different version of the software needs to be maintained. This is likely a
  business decision, but can correlate to making a new product or a release of
  new features separately from an existing product line.
* **Deletion**: A service line should be deleted when it is no longer
  maintained. Remember that the previous history will still exist, and can be
  referenced through tags.
* **Dependencies**: Service lines should have only one type of dependency:
    * Other service lines
* **Dependants**: Feature branches, integration branches, and release candidates
  may all be dependants of service lines, but a service line when it is the only
  service line in a project typically has no dependants.
* **Sub-types**: Service lines can be `main`, a long-term-support branch, a
  seasonal version of the website, or a short-lived demo.
* **Examples**
    * **`main` or `trunk`**:
        * Created when the project is started.
        * Deleted/archived when the project is no longer maintained.
        * Dependencies: All features.
        * Dependants: None.
    * **`line/5.2`**:
        * Created when v5.2.0 is released.
        * Deleted/archived when 5.2.x is no longer maintained.
        * Dependencies: `line/5.1`.
        * Dependants: `line/5.3` or `line/6.0`, depending on which exists, and
          any features intended for `line/5.2` or a new line based on this
          branch (such as when preparing for `line/6.0`).
    * **`line/2024-black-friday-sale`**:
        * Created from `main` when features specific to the 2024 Black Friday
          Sale are ready for release.
        * Deleted/archived after `main` replaces the 2024 Black Friday Sale
          version of the site (such as when the Cyber Monday line is released).
        * Dependencies: `main`.
        * Dependants: Features intended only for the Black Fridy Sale.

### Feature Branches

A "feature branch" is any branch where changes are actively made. This can be
for any reason: adding features, modifying features, bug fixes, updating package
dependencies, improving application framework or reducing boilerplate, etc.
These branches even can be used for collections of changes (epics, etc.) that
will be released as a unit, with descendant feature branches that represent
either sub-features or even sub-tasks!

* **Creation**: A feature branch is created when there is a reason to change
  code. This usually corresponds to a ticket in your team's ticket-tracking
  system, but some teams prefer "infrastructure" changes to be entirely internal
  to the dev team.

    _Note:_ If you don't track "infrastructure" changes as tickets, it reduces
    your project management's team ability to help manage dependency. As tech
    leaders, we should always be leveraging our full teams, even those outside
    of the engineers, to their strenghts!
* **Deletion**: A feature should be removed when it is integrated to its
  destination, either into a service line or to its parent feature branch. (Be
  cautious when removing it if only moved into another feature branch, as some
  organizations will change their minds and want to roll out a feature on its
  own.) A feature should also be removed if the change is no longer desired.
* **Dependencies**: Features typically only have two types of dependencies, but
  occasionally have others:
    * A service line, typically where the feature will eventually reside or
      where the bug originated.
    * Other feature branches, as in the case of using epic branches, or
      infrastructure changes.
    * An integration branch may be added as a dependency of a feature branch if
      two or more dependencies have conflicts and neither is in the dependency
      tree of the other.
* **Dependants**: Feature branches will typically have feature branches,
  integration branches, and release candidates as dependants.
* **Sub-types**: Bug fix branches, task branches, and infrastructure branches
  all count as feature branches.
* **Examples**:
    * **`feature/login-page`**:
        * Created when the login page epic is started.
        * Deleted when the login page epic is released to its respective service
          line.
        * Dependency is `feature/login-apis` from the backend team, which has a
          dependency on `main`. There may also be a dependency on
          `infra/router-upgrade`.
        * Dependants include `task/login-page-validation` and
          `feature/forgot-password-page`, and possibly a release candidate
          branch.
    * **`infra/router-upgrade`**:
        * Created when the front-end team starts upgrading the router packages
          and other routing changes.
        * Deleted when released to the appropriate service line.
        * The only dependency is `main`, but could include other feature branches.
        * Dependants include `feature/login-page` and other feature branches. If
          team leadership chooses, it could be added to a release candiate
          branch.
    * **`task/login-page-validation`**:
        * Created when a developer starts working on the subtask to add
          validation to the login page.
        * Removed when merged into `feature/login-page`.
        * Dependency is the `feature/login-page`.
        * A dependant  could include `task/submit-login-form`.
    * **`bugfix/homepage-typo`**:
        * Created when a typo is detected on the homepage, which was already
          released to main.
        * Deleted when released to main.
        * The only dependency is `main`.
        * No dependants.

### Integration Branches

An "integration branch" is any branch where two (or more) dependencies are
integrated together; no changes should be made on an integration branch other
than to make sure those dependencies work well together. These should be created
any time there are either code conflicts or business logic that requires
additional changes for the two changes to work together.

* **Creation**: Integration branches are created whenever two dependencies
  slated for the same dependant have issues working together, either technical
  (such as a merge conflict) or logical (such as needing to handle both OAuth
  and password-based logins.)
* **Deletion**: An integration branch is deleted when it only has one branch as
  a dependency, such as when one dependency takes on a direct dependency of the
  other(s). When this happens, the integration branch should be "integrated"
  into the other dependency (unless the reason for deletion was cancelling a
  feature.)
* **Dependencies**: An integration branch can have any other branch type (other
  than release candidates) as a dependency. An integration branch should either
  have exactly two dependencies unless all dependencies are integration
  branches.
* **Dependants**: An integration branch can have any other branch type as a
  dependant.
* **Examples**:
    * **`integrate/homepage-router-upgrade`**:
        * Creation: The team decided that the homepage feature (while in
          progress) should not add a dependency to the `infra/router-upgrade`
          before its release, so an integration branch was created to prevent
          conflicts when releasing either.
        * Deletion: When either `infra/router-upgrade` or `feature/homepage` are
          released to `main`, this branch can be merged into the other branch
          then deleted.
        * Dependencies: `infra/router-upgrade` and `feature/homepage`.
        * Dependants: Any release candidate branch, or features that need to
          depend on both the homepage and router upgrade.
    * **`integrate/lines-5.1-5.2`**:
        * Creation: A bugfix to `line/5.1` conflicts with a refactoring applied
          only to `line/5.2`, so an integration branch is made between the two
          to resolve the issue.
        * Deletion: This branch is deleted either when `line/5.1` is no longer
          maintained (and the bug fix is not relevant) or when merged into
          `line/5.2`. (Or if `line/5.2` is also deleted.)
        * Dependencies: `line/5.1` and `line/5.2`.
        * Dependants: Only a release candidate for 5.2 should be a dependant of
          this integration branch.
    * **`integrate/features-a-b-c`**:
        * Creation: `integrate/a-b`, `integrate/b-c`, and `integrate/a-c` all
          needed to be created, so to put them into the same release, all must
          be merged together.
        * Deletion: When any of feature A, B, or C is released, it will cause a
          cascading deletion of integration branches. For example, if C is released first:
            * `integrate/a-c` should be merged into feature A's branch and deleted.
            * `integrate/b-c` should be merged into feature B's branch and deleted.
            * `integrate/a-b-c` should be merged into `integrate/a-b` and deleted.

### Release Candidates

Release candidates are special branch types used for gathering multiple changes
together into one release. A release candidate is only useful so long as it is a
realistic location to test the changes; if it is not actually a "candidate for
release", it is probably not useful. However, some teams like to test all
features in an integrated environment (such as a `develop` branch); a release
candidate pattern may be used for that, too.

* **Creation**: Release candidates may be created any time two or more changes
  need to be tested together.
* **Deletion**: A release candidate should be deleted when merged to the service
  line. This merge may also be tagged.

    _Note:_ A release candidate should be replaced whenever its dependencies
    change; do not make modifications to a release candidate.
* **Dependencies**: Any branch type, including other release candidates, may be
  a dependency of a release candidate.
* **Dependants**: No branches other than release candidates should be a
  dependant of a release candidate.
* **Examples**:
    * **`rc/1.0.1`**:
        * Created when features are ready for an update to `line/1.0`
        * Deleted when merged into `line/1.0` or deleted and recreated when any
          dependency changes.
        * Dependencies should be all features slated for `line/1.0`. These feaures should either have a
          dependency of `line/1.0` or `line/1.0` should also be a dependency
          here, too.
        * `rc/1.1.0` may be a dependant of `rc/1.0.1`.
    * **`rc/2024-11-01`**:
        * Created when the first feature for the Nov 1 release is ready for testing.
        * Deleted when merged into `main` or deleted and recreated when any
          dependency changes.
        * Dependencies should be all features slated for the next release.
        * The only dependants should be other future release candidates.
