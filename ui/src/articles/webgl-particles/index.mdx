export { ogImage };

I started out my career in video games, but recently I've feeling the pull to play around again. It's been interesting
re-learning so much of what I used to know... both humbling and thrilling. Anyway, have a particle system explosion,
running in real-time on your machine:

<ExplosionScene client:idle />

This is done using a 7x7 sprite map for the particles (source from the
[Unity Particle Pack](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/essentials/tutorial-projects/unity-particle-pack-127325))
completed by a custom-built particle engine for [three.js](https://threejs.org/)... and custom GLSL shaders.
That means it's a pretty good test of what modern devices can do even in a browser. Let me know how it works for you!
