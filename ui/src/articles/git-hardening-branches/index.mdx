The principle of [Isolation until Finalized][isolation] from the Scaled Git Flow
branching model is new for many developers: between trunk-based development,
GitFlow, and standard Continuous Deployment workflows, developers don't often
gain the habit of thinking about dependencies between features. As a result,
when teams start developing a large amount of work-in-progress (such as due to a
QA bottleneck or an upstream stability issue), the team chooses to customize
their workflow to reduce isolation. This comes in a form similar to an _epic
branch_.

# The common problem: A moving target

Unfortunately, epics often are released piece-by-piece over time, while branches
are released as a unit. Shortly after creating these branches, they run into an
issue: an incomplete feature was merged into the epic branch, often after the
branch had started QA, both invalidating much of the QA already done (at least,
in strict QA scenarios) and making the branch unsuitable to release.

## The Solution: Hardening Branches

Instead of releasing the epic directly if there are any outstanding features or
stories to contribute to it, create a _hardening branch_ between the epic branch
and its upstream branches. This hardening branch can have as much or as little
of the epic branch's code added to it; ideally, it should be created at a commit
already from the history of the epic branch. Bugfixes, etc. can then be applied
to the hardening branch which will [propagate downstream][propagate] into the
epic branch. This hardening branch can then be used in the release candidate.

More importantly, because this is a new branch, developers already working on
features for the epic in future releases do not need to change their workflow
when a release is created.

Reintegration branches should be retired when either the release is finalized or
cancelled.

## [Scalable Git Branchnig Tools][git-tools]

There is a [set of tools for working with the Scalable Git Branching
Model][git-tools] that we created at Principle Studios. When using these tools,
follow these steps to create a hardening branch:

1. Locate the commit from which to create the hardening branch. (This is similar
   to starting a release branch in GitFlow.) Create the new branch on your
   remote; in this case, let's say my epic was `epic/cms-reorganization` and I'm
   releasing on May 28, 2024, so my command would look something like:

   ```sh
   git push origin COMMIT:refs/heads/epic/cms-reorganization-2024-05-28
   ```

2. Add upstreams to the new branch. This should probably be all of the upstreams
   of the epic from before, but if you chose an older commit, maybe not
   everything was already in at that time.

   ```sh
   git add-upstream -target epic/cms-reorganization-2024-05-28 infra/modal-framework,infra/cms-migration-framework
   ```

3. Add the new branch upstream of the old epic. This should result in
   simplifying its upstreams.

   ```sh
   git add-upstream -target epic/cms-reorganization epic/cms-reorganization-2024-05-28
   ```

That's all there is to it! The hardening branch may be safely added to the
release candidate, bugfixes will propagate to the original epic branch via `git
pull-upstream`, and developers working on the epic rather than the release can
continue to work as they have been.

# A new problem: Short-term fixes

Sometimes, a hardening branch needs a short-term fix that should not apply to
the full epic. (This can also happen beween service lines, too.) This can take
place in a handful of scenarios:

- an infrastructure branch was not ready to be released with the current release
  and can't be fixed,
- a specific feature needed to be disabled manually rather than via a feature
  flag, such as a button leading to the half-complete feature on the homepage, or
- a process needs to work one way in the short term but overall the epic intends
  to change the process.

## Another solution: Reintegration Branches

In this case, we need yet another branch - a _reintegration branch_. This is yet
another new type of branch that is very similar to an integration branch, but it
will go between two branches rather than combining two branches. In this case,
we put the reintegration branch between the hardening branch and the epic.

Using the git tools, it would look like this:

```sh
git new epic/cms-reorganization-2024-05-28-reintegrate -u epic/cms-reorganization-2024-05-28
git add-upstream -target epic/cms-reorganization epic/cms-reorganization-2024-05-28-reintegrate
```

The purpose of the reintegrate branch is to _undo_ the unwanted changes from the
tracked upstream.

A common scenario: An unwanted feature was added to the hardening branch before
it was created.
1. Identify the commit in the hardening branch.
2. Run `git revert` on the offending commit.
3. Merge the hardening branch into the reintegration branch (such as via `git
   pull-upstream`).
4. Run `git revert` on the newly created revert commit to restore the functionality
   back.
5. Merge the reintegration branch into its downstream.

Reintegration branches may also be used between service lines (such as when
preserving a change for the next major version), but merges into the downstream
service line may require pull-requests of their own!

Reintegration branches may be retired when their upstream branch is retired.

# Conclusion: Two new branch types

The two new branch types for "hardening" and "reintegration" branches allow for
a much wider variety of use-cases within the Scalable Git Branching Model. I
hope this article helps implementing them within your team!
