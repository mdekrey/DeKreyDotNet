description: Principle Studios has a unique way of conducting interviews that has helped us to build a better team to support our clients... and is unintimidating for interviewees!

_Note: This article as originally published on the [Principle Studios

Now that Principle Studios is part of Shift Paradigm, I have republished the
article here for posterity._

Here at Principle Studios, we know that interviewing for a new job can be
intimidating, especially for software engineers. From whiteboard coding,
"gotcha" questions, and even "how would you solve this problem that we
encountered recently," there's a lot of really unpleasant interview practices
within the software engineering industry. For instance, a previous employer
asked me this during an interview:

> On the whiteboard, can you write out the algorithm you'd use to tally a count
> of each unique word in a given text file? The file can be up to 4GB in size.

Given questions like these, researching the interview process for a company
you're applying for (if it's a big one) is critical, but that implies that
"interviewing" is a special skill... which leads us to believe that the best
candidates may not "interview" well based on the industry standard. Needless to
say, we were curious if there was a better way.

Understanding why something has been developed is a key part of being a good
software engineer. After I joined the company with the above interview question,
I started asking questions... I realized that someone had to solve the problem
at some point in the history of the team, and they'd been using it as an
interview question ever since.

After examining the problem space for a bit, I realized that much of interview
processes were almost the result of an "overfitting" algorithm - companies write
a test that existing employees pass, and ensures new employees can solve the old
problems... but this can lead to a troublesome situation when new issues arise,
since everyone approaches the problems the same way.

# Designing Something Better

I rarely like re-inventing the wheel, but sometimes it's important to do it to
achieve something better, especially after researching why something came about
in the first place. As a result, I spent some time finding the goal of an
interview process - which I decided, put simply, is "to find the ideal candidate
for the role." Unfortunately, that definition was too broad to be useful. I
worked with our team and, after some iteration of interview processes (and some
successful hires!), we arrived at four key qualities for an ideal software
engineer:

- Be aligned with our [company cultural values][1]
- Have the skills necessary to do the current job today
- Have the potential to grow to one of the best in the industry
- Be flexible enough in their work process to accomodate our clients'
  sometimes-unusual workflows

Initially, we didn't have the fourth point, but we wanted each interviewer to be
able to focus on just one of these qualities, and it'd be easy to find a software
engineer or manager to interview for each aspect.

# Cross-Cutting Concerns

We had to acknowledge that there's more to an interview than just that. One of
the great things I'd experienced at a previous employer (the same one with the
interview question I shared above) was a "cross-department" interview - from
that, I could see what the other departments thought of the engineering team.
Along with that, we established a few other aspects of the process:

- Make sure our best candidates can work well with other departments
- Give candidates the opportunity to interview us
- Make the entire process enjoyable

To address these points, we make sure that non-engineers participate as
interviewers as much as we can (and give them equal weight in the decision
making process), allow for plenty of time in the interview for candidates to
ask us about Principle and our work (usually at the front and after the main
parts), and try to make the interviews as conversational as possible.

That last bit - making the interviews conversational - brings out another
exciting portion... as one of our newest hires, Megan Kossa, puts it:

> One of the best things about meeting new devs is shooting the breeze with some
> inspiring and interesting ideas. Why can't that be part of the interview
> process too?

Sometimes interviews are so fun that I've gotten feedback at the end of the
interview that the candidate got caught so off guard by our conversation that
they didn't realize the interview was over and they felt they may have said the
wrong thing by being too honest or not sticking to "interview culture." As much
as I don't want someone to be worried that they bombed an interview with us, the
advice I share: seeing your true and honest self during the interview process
gets us excited to work with you.

# Putting It All Together

Between the qualities and aspects, we wanted to cover, we had our work cut out
for us and our interviewers.

Ultimately, each interviewer is encouraged to conduct their interview in nearly
any way they choose to be able to answer their particular question. That being
said, we have a few rules for the technical interviewers, some of which include:
no "trivia" questions, no whiteboard coding, encourage creative solutions.

We ended up with four overall interviews. We always do the "cultural values"
interview first, but the other three could happen in any order, though we
usually have the technical interviews 2nd and 3rd so that candidates can be
clear that those will be technical.

## Cultural values

Our first interview always addresses our [core cultural values][1]. Presently,
one of our executive board members runs this interview, making sure everyone's
expectations match, including what internal culture is like and how that blends
with the expectations from our clients.

## Skilled For Today

To see if a candidate has the skills we're looking for currently, we invite
them to share code they're passionate about that they've written! We ask them
to walk one of us through it, allowing us to ask questions and dive into the
parts they're most excited about. Seeing another developer get excited is
infectious for our team, and gets us to see the candidate at their best:
worries tend to wash away and we all have a great time, knowing exactly how
someone can fit into our existing team.

## Potential To Grow

To see if a candidate has the potential to grow, we share some of our
(non-client) code and treat it like an onboarding session! We believe that code
should be read dozens of times more often than it is written, so having
candidates read code during the interview sets that trend early. After a canned
bit of onboarding, we let them look anywhere in that codebase, answering any
questions or highlighting some of the parts we're most excited about. The way
they move through the codebase, dig into and talk about boilerplate, and even
what kinds of things they find interesting and exciting tells our interviewer a
lot about how the candidate will want to grow in the future.

## Flexible For Clients

Usually our last interview, one of our project managers usually leads a
conversation about the candidate's needs in a work environment. Here we look for
flexibility - a strict adherance to a particular SDLC (software development life
cycle), tool, or other development practice usually means that we wouldn't be an
ideal long-term fit for the candidate; they would not stay happy here for long.
This is partly because our clients each have their own process requirements; in
the consulting realm, some clients practice waterfall, many do not value
automated tests, and some prefer manual deployments. However, some of it is also
due to our curious nature: we like to try new things, sometimes often, to see if
they'll help us. That said, when we do find those candidates who are hungry to
learn about how other teams do things, try it out, and even have other ideas to
try out... we get excited to work with them, too!

# Closing Notes

In my humble opinion, the best part of our interview process is that, by meeting
our candidates in areas that get us all excited, we can get past the nervousness
and really see the best in each person who applies. Sometimes we meet a great
engineer and know that, while they may not be a fit for the current position,
they will be a fit in the future, and it's not uncommon for us to reach out
again later and ask if they're still interested.

Anyway, I hope that demystifies our interview process a bit for you and
encourages just a few of you who are nervous about looking for your next career
move to reach out and see that an interview process can actually be enjoyable!
