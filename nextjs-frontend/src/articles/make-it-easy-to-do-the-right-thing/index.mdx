Generally speaking, employees want to be good at their jobs. We like to know that the people around us can depend on us
to get our responsibilities done, and we want to help improve the overall quality of life of everyone involved.
Especially with the high-quality teams that I usually find myself a part of, everyone would prefer we're all moving in
the "right direction," though we may disagree on what that direction is.

However, despite us all wanting to move together, there tends to be friction, especially when timelines are short:
situations frequently come up where we do the wrong thing! Why is that?

# Make it easy to do the right thing

As a software architect, I don't see myself as the gatekeeper of architecture for my teams - on the contrary,
architecture is everyone's responsibility. Instead, I see my responsibility as helping people make the right decisions
to make the right thing be the easiest thing to do. As [Scott Hanselman](https://www.hanselman.com/) frequently says,
I want everyone to "fall into the pit of success..." the earliest reference I can find is via an
[old archive of Brad Abrams' blog](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/archive/blogs/brada/the-pit-of-success):

> **The Pit of Success:** in stark contrast to a summit, a peak, or a journey across a desert to find victory through
> many trials and surprises, we want our customers to simply fall into winning practices by using our platform and
> frameworks. To the extent that we make it easy to get into trouble we fail.
>
> &mdash; Rico Mariani, MS Research MindSwap Oct 2003

Ultimately, success must be easier to do than failure - the right thing must be harder to do than the wrong thing.

# Making the wrong thing harder

Often, I'll work with an engineering team and talk about architecture updates - how we can make dependency management
clearer, upgrade an aging technology stack, how we can make an application more secure. The entire team seems on
board... but if I let it slide thinking my job is done, I'll come back months later without any changes to what has
been occurring. Are the teams malicious? Of course not! Are they not contradicting me even though they disagree?
Possibly, but I feel like I do a pretty good job establishing that I'm not perfect in my decisions - I encourage
disagreements in planning stages, ask others their opinions &mdash; especially new folks, as they have fresh external
viewpoints! &mdash; and most importantly, change my mind when someone presents a better option. Are they lazy?
Definitely not; despite my best efforts to encourage people to take personal time, I had extra team members volunteer
for the latest late-night release for a client, and engineers talking about "cheating" on their holiday time because
they were excited about upcoming projects. (You know who you are; I really wish you wouldn't. But I ðŸ’— you all anyway.)

(As an aside: I don't believe [greenfield projects](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greenfield_project) are a solution for
bad architectural decisions. This costs too much, and the path to being feature parity with the old version is littered
with conflicts of interest. Instead, refactoring an existing project, team, etc. is encouraged. I approach the code with
the same respect I do existing teams: they were built for a reason, and without understanding
[Chesterton's Fence](https://thoughtbot.com/blog/chestertons-fence) we're doomed to repeat the same mistakes.)

Instead, I feel that the failure lies in making it easy. This means not just defining the end goal, but making sure each
intermediate step is easier than the last.

- Converting from Angular to React is hard. Ensure that the React code is easy to write:
	- Start with a process that ensures the new React code is easy to write: use the latest technologies, make it easy
	  to upgrade by itself, make it testable, make it use a separate build process... whatever you need to make it the
	  best.
	- Write an adapter layer that is easy to use so that engineers can easily write something enjoyable in React and
	  leverage it within the legacy codebase.
	- Write an adapter layer for all the non-React business logic such that it can be migrated out of the legacy code.
	- Prioritize finishing sections of legacy code so they are fully converted.
- Improving dependency management is hard. Ensure the refactoring is easier than the old code:
	- Create a framework that easily references new packages but cannot reference the old code. Don't try to move
	  anything yet!
	- Ensure the old code can reference the new code. Move something small to ensure it can be done very easily.
	- Start making a handful of smaller packages. These packages should have clearly defined boundaries; don't make a
	  "utilities" package, but instead make an "http utilities" package. Don't make a "user management" package,
	  make a "login" package that depends on other smaller packages.
	- Once you have a few packages, retroactively figure out what the strategy was for splitting each one the way you
	  did. Read through the strategies, does it make sense? Have others read them. Does it make sense to them?
	- Clearly define the vision based on those strategies. Make sure it doesn't have exceptions!
	- Write a decision-making matrix to help engineers in the future define new packages; the existing strategies should
	  be able to be determined from that matrix. Reduction in decision making will help the more junior developers still
	  do the right thing!
- Improving security is hard. Work to construct a process that makes creating a secure application easier than an
  unsecure application.
	- Make new Secrets in AWS Secrets Manager (or other secrets vault) easier than adding generic storage or
	  configuration values! Make it easy for secrets to be updated and changed without checking into source control.
	  .NET does this for local development with the `dotnet user-secrets` command.
	- Make getting necessary permissions for users, especially in lower environments, easier than sharing credentials.
	  This means rapidly approving and provisioning permissions, but keeping them granular enough that shared
	  credentials don't usually help. It can also mean restricting credentials to being used from only one location at
	  a time, requiring SSL public/private keys, MFA, IP filtering, etc.
	- Make getting granular permissions for new services, or adding permissions to existing services, easier than adding
	  user credentials to those services. (This includes build systems.)
	- Make getting new credentials for a new service easier than accessing the existing credentials for an existing
	  service.
	- When moving to a more secure system, make sure you work with people that use the system already to make sure the
	  new system will work for them - don't surprise them with sudden decreased access.
	- Make a list of legacy credentials and audit them on a rolling basis to eliminate them and move to new credentials.
	  Prioritize this work as the new systems become more and more standard.

# Organizational Policies

From my formal education, I know this doesn't apply just to engineering. Setting up organizational alignment is only a
start; making it easy for every employee, from the directors to the line managers and even employees, to make the right
decision in the moment should move the company in a positive direction every day, for every decision.

- Set up a vision for where the organization will go.
- Look at the decision points that get made each day - from what contracts to sign, to how to allocate employee time.
  Make strategies to inform those decisions.
- From there, set policies that help guide people into making the right decision; leave their decision making for the
  important parts that you can't write into policy!

A simple example may be an airline policy, when the company values comfort of employees, but doesn't want to spend too
much, but knows that an employee's time is billable. In this case, simple rules may help:
- Employees may ride any non-luxury airline they wish, but any upgrade beyond "extra leg room" would be an expense for
  the employee.
- Luggage charges are to be covered by the company.
- If the flight is more than 2 hours, in-air internet may be expensed if at least 30 minutes of time is billable.
- Direct flights are preferred to minimize employee's in-airport time.
- Red-eye flights are not necessary.
- Airport parking or transport to/from the airport is covered by the company.

Slogans from both past and current employers indicate this, too:
- We are who we are, because of who we are together.
- Do good work. Be good people.

A proper set of policies can help improve a codebase or an organization. Make sure you're making it easy to do the
right thing all the way through the migration process!
